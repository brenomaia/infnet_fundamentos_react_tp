            <h2>Breno Maia</h2>
            <p>I am a software developer with a sales background, which I believe have always helped me communicating with my team and other stakeholders. My first programming lesson was in Python in Engineering School and a few years later I had an idea of an app but knew no developers. I decided then to start learning on my own, so I started studying swift and iOS Programming. I had 2 apps in the AppStore a few months later but they did not go so well. With the skills I had learned I decided to join a company as a developer, which is where I am to this day. </p>
